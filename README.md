# Order Management API Platform

## Overview
The Order Management API Platform is a backend service built using Java Spring Boot. This platform provides functionalities for user authentication, order management, and order dispatching. The API is secured with JWT-based authentication, and features include user registration, login, order placement, order cancellation, and fetching order history.

---

## Features
1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - User signup with email, password, first name, and last name.
   - User login with email and password.
   - JWT-based security for all APIs (except signup and login).

2. **Order Management**
   - Place an order by specifying item name, quantity, and shipping address.
   - Cancel orders in the `NEW` state using the order reference number.
   - Fetch order history with pagination (page number and record size).

3. **Background Job**
   - An hourly background job updates the status of `NEW` orders to `DISPATCHED`.

4. **Database**
   - MySQL database with JPA repository for persistence.

5. **Dockerized Application**
   - Fully containerized backend application for easy deployment.
